/*Raul P. Pelaez 2017. A Brownian Dynamics with Hydrodynamic Interactions simulation.

Runs a Brownian Hydrodynamics simulation with particles starting in a box, particles have different radius and interact with a LJ potential.

Needs cli input arguments with a system size, etc, look for "argv"

Or just run: ./a.out 10 25 0.005 20000 1 0.5 1.0 
for a quick test

You can visualize the reuslts with superpunto
